Functional Requirements
User Authentication:
The system must provide a user authentication mechanism using unique usernames and passwords to access the web interface.

QR Code Scanning:
The system must allow library visitors to scan a QR code at the library entrance or in different sections to access the book retrieval web interface.

Book Search:
The system must enable users to search for specific books by title, author, ISBN number, or category.

Book Availability Check:
The system must verify the availability of the searched book in real-time and update the status accordingly.

Book Location Identification:
The system must identify the exact physical location of the book on the shelves and display it on a user-friendly map.

Automated Book Retrieval:
The system must communicate with the robotic arm to pick up a requested book from its designated shelf and deliver it to the collection point.

Book Reservation:
The system must allow users to reserve books that are currently checked out and send a notification when the book is returned.

User Notifications:
The system must notify users via email or in-app messages when their reserved book is available for pickup, when there is a system issue, or when a bookâ€™s due date is approaching.

Book Pickup Confirmation:
The system must record and confirm the pickup of a book and update the inventory to reflect the transaction.

User Session Management:
The system must track and manage user sessions securely, maintaining user activity until the session is manually ended or times out.

Admin Dashboard:
The system must provide an admin dashboard that allows administrators to add, update, or delete books in the inventory and track system activity.

Book Borrowing and Returning:
The system must facilitate book borrowing and returning processes by updating the book status in the database when checked out or returned.

System Maintenance and Logs:
The system must maintain logs of all user and admin activities and provide access for the library admin to monitor and address any issues.

Multi-language Support:
The system must support multiple languages to accommodate diverse user groups.

User Account Management:
The system must allow users to create, edit, and delete their profiles, along with viewing their borrowing history and preferences.

Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:
The system must respond to user interactions on the web interface within 2 seconds for 95% of users, even under peak load conditions.

Scalability:
The system must handle up to 500 concurrent users without performance degradation and must be able to add additional server instances to accommodate more users as required.

Security:
The system must encrypt all user data and book inventory information using AES-256 encryption and implement measures to prevent unauthorized access.

Usability:
The user interface must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility

Reliability:
The system must achieve an uptime of 99.5% over a year, excluding planned maintenance, and should automatically recover from unexpected outages.

Data Integrity:
The system must ensure that all updates to the book database are atomic, ensuring that the book information is never left in an incomplete state.

Interoperability:
The system must be compatible with different devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers, and support various web browsers.

Response Time:
Book search and availability checks must be completed in less than 3 seconds for most searches.

Constraints
Technology Constraint:
The system must be developed using Python for backend processing and React for the front-end user interface.

Regulatory and Compliance Constraint:
The system must comply with GDPR regulations for data privacy and follow industry-specific standards for handling user data securely.

Resource Constraint:
The system should not exceed 70% CPU and memory utilization on the server during peak hours.

Budget Constraint:
The total project budget must not exceed $200,000, which includes hardware procurement, software development, testing, and deployment.

Hardware Limitations:
The robotic arm must have a reach of at least 2.5 meters to access books on all shelves and be able to pick books weighing up to 2 kg.

Operating System Constraint:
The server infrastructure must run on Linux-based systems.
